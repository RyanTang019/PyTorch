# PyTorch-
My journey of learning PyTorch 1 portion at a time.

The 00_fundamentals notebook consisits of the basics like matrix multiplication as well as basic pytorch commands and how tensors work.

The second 01_workflow notebook outlines how to build a simple PyTorch model from start to end. Firstly we have to prepare the data and turn them into tensors, followed by building a model (picking a loss function and optimizer, and building a training loop). Fitting the model to the data and making a prediction, evaluating the model and then improving the model through experimentation
