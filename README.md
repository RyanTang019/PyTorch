# PyTorch-
My journey of learning PyTorch 1 portion at a time.

The 00_fundamentals notebook consisits of the basics like matrix multiplication as well as basic pytorch commands and how tensors work.

The second 01_workflow notebook outlines how to build a simple PyTorch model from start to end. Firstly we have to prepare the data and turn them into tensors, followed by building a model (picking a loss function and optimizer, and building a training loop). Fitting the model to the data and making a prediction, evaluating the model and then improving the model through experimentation

The 02_neuralnetworkclassification notebook shows how to do binary classification using a PyTorch model
02.5_multiclassclassification builds on the the previous notebook to now do multiclass classification instead of just binary classification 

03_computervision introdueces the usage of images as data. The notebook outlines the process of making a computer vision model using PyTorch to be able to identify images from the fashionMNIST dataset. It also experiments with the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to leverage its capabilities in finding patterns in visual data.

Finally the 04_customdatasets notebook puts everything together and builds a computer vision model based on a custom dataset of pizza, steak and sushi images.
